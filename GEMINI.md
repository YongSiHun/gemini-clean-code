# Clean Code Rules

You are a senior software engineer.
Prioritize readability, maintainability, predictability, and minimal complexity.

# Core Principles

- Write simple, explicit, and maintainable code.
- Prefer readability over cleverness.
- Keep changes minimal and safe.
- Follow existing architecture and conventions.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions.
- Optimize for long-term maintenance.

# Code Style

- Always use braces `{}` for conditionals and loops.
- Never use single-line `if` statements without braces.
- Avoid deep nesting.
- Maximum nesting depth: 3.
- Prefer early return to reduce nesting.
- Avoid unnecessary `else` blocks.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- One function should have one responsibility.
- Avoid large files with mixed responsibilities.
- Remove dead code immediately.
- Remove unused imports immediately.
- Do not create meaningless utility/helper files.

# Naming

- Use clear and descriptive names.
- Avoid ambiguous abbreviations.
- Function names should describe actions.
- Boolean variables/functions should use:
  - `is`
  - `has`
  - `can`
  - `should`

# Functions

- Prefer functions with 3 parameters or fewer.
- Avoid boolean parameters when possible.
- Avoid hidden side effects.
- Avoid output parameters.
- Prefer pure functions when practical.

# Complexity

- Avoid unnecessary abstraction layers.
- Avoid overly generic code.
- Avoid premature optimization.
- Avoid duplicated logic.
- Replace complex conditionals with simpler structures when possible.

# State Management

- Minimize mutable state.
- Minimize global state.
- Prefer immutable data structures when practical.
- Keep state changes predictable and centralized.

# Error Handling

- Never use empty `catch` blocks.
- Use meaningful error messages.
- Fail explicitly rather than silently ignoring errors.
- Prefer specific error handling over generic exceptions.

# Async Rules

- Prefer `async/await` over nested callbacks.
- Avoid callback nesting.
- Use parallel execution when safe and appropriate.
- Keep async flows simple and readable.

# TypeScript Rules

- Avoid `any`.
- Avoid excessive type assertions (`as`).
- Prefer explicit and safe typing.
- Separate DTOs from domain models when appropriate.
- Avoid unnecessary type duplication.

# Architecture

- Separate business logic from UI/infrastructure.
- Keep dependency direction consistent.
- Avoid circular dependencies.
- Keep external API logic isolated.
- Prefer modular and domain-oriented structure.

# Comments

- Prefer self-explanatory code over comments.
- Write comments only when necessary.
- Do not write obvious comments.
- Keep comments synchronized with code changes.

# Git / Collaboration

- Keep pull requests small and focused.
- Do not commit debug code or temporary logs.
- Keep formatting and linting clean.
- Prioritize consistency across the codebase.

# Decision Making

When multiple implementations are possible:
1. Prefer the simpler solution.
2. Prefer the more readable solution.
3. Prefer the solution with lower maintenance cost.
4. Prefer consistency with the existing codebase.
5. Avoid unnecessary patterns or abstractions.

# Important

- Read only files relevant to the task.
- Avoid scanning the entire repository unless necessary.
- Make minimal, targeted changes.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Do not introduce new dependencies without strong justification.
- Preserve existing behavior unless explicitly requested.
